PC Care Utility

Introduction:
PC Care Utility is a software which is used for the safe system maintenance of a Windows based computer.  It was created to solve the problem of unsafe or “scareware” PC cleaners.

• I myself created this software for the easy access to all basic tools used for cleaning up a Windows PC after realizing that I spent too much time opening all these utilities for only the basic maintenance of my PC.

• I went with the idea ‘safety first’. I add no bloat and made it a basic software with an included source code. My software is opensource, meaning it has a share source-code to the general public.

• This software has no fake “errors” related to your files. No data is collected, and as for the destructive actions, clear confirmation is taken from the users by asking “Y/N” or typing “DELETE”.

• This software is targeted to Windows 10 and 11 users who require safe maintenance for their computers, and also for people who are privacy conscious. Not only can this be used by people who just want everything to be done in a hurry, but also by beginners who want simplicity.

• The software is currently on V2.2, but I haven’t released my previous versions. It is a stable software and is production-ready. I am planning on actively maintaining this software for as long as I can and ensuring that I maintain the simplicity I stand by.

Safety & Security Notes

• This tool never accesses BIOS/UEFI, edits registry, or disables security features. 
• Zero telemetry – no data is collected or sent anywhere. 
• Downloads folder deletion is IRREVERSIBLE – requires typing DELETE to confirm. All operations are read-only unless explicitly confirmed by the user. 
• Built with open-source transparency so you can verify every line of code.

FAQ
